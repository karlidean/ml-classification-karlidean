    "**Purpose:** Heart conditions and diseases run rampant throughout the United States. So, much that 1 in 3 deaths in the United States are related to a heart condition, making it the leading cause of death in most racial and ethnic groups, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html). Heart disease is something near and dear to my own heart (no pun intended) as it is something I am at risk of genealogically. My grandfather was many a victim to heart attacks, and I have other family members who suffer from diabetes, which can affect the heart due to misregulation of sugar in the blood. This classification analysis will make for a way to understand if someone is at risk for this kind of health concern."
