# Peer Review - Midterm Part 2
--  Reviewing a Peer's Midterm --

**Author of THIS REVIEW:** Karli Dean\
**Author of the ORIGINAL PROJECT:** [Nathan Sloss](https://github.com/nwn8/applied-ml-nates/blob/main/notebooks/Midterm/classification_NathanSloss.ipynb)\
**Date:** November 11, 2025

## Section 1 - Organization and Clarity
I can see what Nathan is doing in his repository, I just sometimes couldn't figure out why. For example, I don't know where he trained or tested his data? In an early snippet (#41), he calls the training df\
yet never shows how or why that df exists as opposed to a testing set. I feel his repo would benefit from better organization.\
Another way I got a little bit confused was when I was reading through feature selection, and I had to keep scrolling back and forth between the notebook and losing my place. I think if there were more descriptiveness there, it would be an easier read.


## Section 2 - Feature Selection and Justification
There was no justification for the features chosen. I don't know why the author thinks the ticket class and fare are different cases for this author.


## Section 3 - Model Performance and Comparisons
All of his models seem to return the same results on an average. However, we don't see a grand comparison at the end comparing all cases and all models (similar to what we did in the previous project).\
He only shows a grand comparison for the Pclass feature models. He mentions how Pclass performed the best, but I think as analysts we need to see all outputs.


## Section 4 - Reflection Quality
His reflections seem bland and not as insightful. They do not seem to answer the questions that were outlined in the example/direction repo. Granted, that repo is just giving us suggestions to write\
in our reflection, but going through them step by step does make for insightful reflections.
