# Peer Review - Midterm Part 2
--  Reviewing a Peer's Midterm --

## Section 1 - Organization and Clarity
I can see what Nathan is doing in his repository, I just sometimes couldn't figure out why. For example, I don't know where he trained or tested his data? In an early snippet (#41), he calls the training df\
yet never shows how or why that df exists as opposed to a testing set. I feel his repo would benefit from better organization.


## Section 2 - Feature Selection and Justification


## Section 3 - Model Performance and Comparisons
All of his models seem to return the same results on an average. However, we don't see a grand comparison at the end comparing all cases and all models (similar to what we did in the previous project).\
He only shows a grand comparison for the Pclass feature models. He mentions how Pclass performed the best, but I think as analysts we need to see all outputs.


## Section 4 - Reflection Quality
His reflections seem bland and not as insightful. They do not seem to answer the questions that were outlined in the example/direction repo. Granted, that repo is just giving us suggestions to write\
in our reflection, but going through them step by step does make for insightful reflections.
